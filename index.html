                    <p>
                        Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It's often referred to as an "ice giant" because it's primarily composed of icy and gaseous materials.

                        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system. It's known for its distinct bluish-green color and is often referred to as an "ice giant." Uranus has a unique feature in that it rotates on its side, with its poles nearly in line with its orbital plane.

                    <p>
                        Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is known for its stunning and iconic ring system. It's a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Saturn has at least 83 confirmed moons, with Titan being the largest and notable for its thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes.

                    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant characterized by its prominent bands of clouds and the Great Red Spot, a massive storm. It has at least 79 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. Jupiter's immense size and strong magnetic field make it a key player in our solar system's dynamics, and it's a popular target for both amateur and professional astronomers.
